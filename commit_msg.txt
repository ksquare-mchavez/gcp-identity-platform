The work product of this phase should be a short document that contains:
- Description of the necessary setup
- API endpoints to call for the different operations
- Sample curl commands to test the flow of operations
 
The goal is to demonstrate the following operations:
 
1. Sign up user (email-only / password-less)
2. Sign in user (ideally email-only / password-less, but could use
   pre-registered email-password pairs for early testing)
3. Receive a payload containing access token (JWT) + refresh token.
4. Get the certificate / public key to verify the signature of the JWT
5. Get a new JWT access token using the refresh token.
 
The document should be usable by an iOS engineer to implement the client-side
logic for the above operations.
